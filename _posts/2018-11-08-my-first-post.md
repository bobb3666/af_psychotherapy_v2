This is an example of a post using markdown script. A post will look something like this. You can do lots of things in a blog post. 

One example of such things is headings, there are different sizes of headings

# This is a big heading
## This is a smaller heading
### This is a smaller smaller heading
#### You probably won't go much smaller for a heading than this 
##### But you can

You can also do lists:

- This is a list
- Of things
- In a list

And quotes 

> 'This is a fucking quote I think' - Albert Einstein.

You can put links to other websites: [Google](https://www.google.com.au). 

And you can put images too:

Its all very fun.
